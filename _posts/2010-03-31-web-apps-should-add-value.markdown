On the topic of webapps. Stop focusing on delivering content. Focus on adding value.

I met with a couple entrepreneurs this last week. These guys were great! They were motivated and tenacious; the kind of kids you want running companies you participate in.

They both software ideas that were about users getting content more conveniently via micro-desktop apps, and iPad apps.

Real powerful webapps like Instapaper, Mint.com and Digg don’t just give you content, they add value. Instapaper doesnt just bookmark, it strips out the crap, and saves the text on your device for offline consumption. Mint doesn’t save your transactions, I sorts, categorizes and graphs them (something Bank and Fidelity have failed to do). Digg doesn’t just tell you what’s on the web about some topic, it croud sources the valuation of web content within each realm.

I can’t say it better than this:

>“The future of our industry now looks totally different than the past. It looks like a sheet of paper, and it’s called the iPad. It’s not about typing or clicking; it’s about touching. It’s not about text, or even animation, it’s about video. It’s not about a local disk, or even a desktop, it’s about the cloud. It’s not about pulling information; it’s about push. It’s not about repurposing old software, it’s about writing everything from scratch (because you want to take advantage of the awesome potential of the new computers and the new cloud—and because you have to reach this pinnacle). Finally, the industry is fun again.” - [Marc Benioff](http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/29/ipad-cloud-2/), Salesforce CEO

It’s a major paradigm shift. It’s about computing with content that is
delivered exactly how the consumer needs it. It’s about working with the
content in a way the consumer wants it, not in a way the developer sees
fit to give it.

Old bottles can’t handle the new wine that’s coming.
