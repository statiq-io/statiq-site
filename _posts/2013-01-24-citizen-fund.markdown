Bryce Roberts posted about a service called [SeeClickFix](http://seeclickfix.com):

>As with most crowd funding campaigns, these projects can be opened to anyone, anywhere to back. Given the right tools, I think they’d be surprised at the results the creativity and networks of their citizens can produce.

>I’m really excited to watch SeeClickFix try and cut through the red tape and constrains of cities around the country and hope to see other city councils move forward with pilots. 

This is very much one of the coolest projects I've seen in the funding community. If you believe in private funding rather than government then 'be the change you want to see in the world'. 

I'm glad that Bryce and his team saw potential in SeeClickFix. This certainly is something awesome.
