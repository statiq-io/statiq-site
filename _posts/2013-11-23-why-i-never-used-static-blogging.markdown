Why I'm Moving My Clients to Static Blogging

1. Never heard of it

I just got introduced to the idea of static blogging this weekend. I have a Wordpress site, and that's the only thing I've ever heard of when it comes to blogging. Wordpress was synonomous with Blog in my mind. Now that I know about it, I'm hooked!

A good friend shares the awesome things they find. Static blogging is going to make you geeks out there feel like you hit the jackpot.

2. It sounded complicated

It's not as complicated as I thought. Honestly, it was something new to learn, and when I have a million things to learn, I have to budget my time. What I didn't realize, is how easy [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) would be to learn. I actually learned it all in a few hours the first night of Startup Weekend after browsing their [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

I started the weekend with no knowledge of Jekyll, and will finish with a Jekyll site of my own. It really was fast and easy.

3. No good themes

Apparently there isn't a good place to get beautiful themes for Jekyll, [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/), or any other static blogging engine. 

The lack of design is probably because no one has ever heard of them, and it sounds complicated. Statiq is changing that, by making static blogging easier and educating people on its advantages.
