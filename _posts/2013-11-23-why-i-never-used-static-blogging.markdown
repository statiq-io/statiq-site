Why I'm Moving My Clients to Static Site Engines

It's been a whirlwind of a weekend learning and working with static blog engines. In order to understand why I'm moving over my clients, let me talk a little bit about how we got to today.

**Static blogging? Never heard of it.**

I just got introduced to the idea of static blogging this weekend. I have a Wordpress site, and that's the only thing I've ever used when it comes to my personal and client sites. Wordpress was synonomous with creating a website in my mind. Now that I know about static blogging, that is all changing.

A static blog generator takes a folder of text files, churns it into a theme, and spits out straight HTML code. Even low-end servers can host thousands of simultaneous visitors when all it's doing is serving up a tiny HTML file. No more database calls. No more melting servers. No more complicated plugins. Just a folder of text files, and a cheap server to host the resulting HTML.

My goal is to get my site and all of my clients moved over to static blogs within two weeks.

**It seemed complicated**

48 hours ago, I knew nothing about static blogging. I had heard of the concept, it sounded cool, but I had a hundred other things to do. I sat down to learn about Jekyll thinking it'd take me the weekend to get a site up and running. I started the weekend with no knowledge of Jekyll, and will finish with having developed multiple Jekyll templates, and running a Jekyll site of my own. It was fast and easy.

I partnered with a few friends, and we came up with Statiq. We make beautiful, ridiculously fast websites using gorgeous themes and static blogging engines. We've released our first two themes, and to celebrate the weekend, we're giving away lifetime memberships. More info below.

**The non-custom themes suck**

If there was a good place to get beautiful themes for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/), or any other static blogging engine, I couldn't find it.

I get it. There's little motivation to design premium themes when there are so few users. And there are so few users because there aren't a ton of great themes. Chicken, meet egg. That's where Statiq comes in, we are making static blogging easier, and a whole lot better looking.

Right now, for the first 20 customers, if you [buy our first theme](http://www.store.statiq.io/), you'll get a **free lifetime membership access** to all of our future themes, as well as access to use our static blog engine, which will provide a slick interface for you to edit your blog, and generate the html files for you. This is an amazing deal if you get in early!
