LearnStack was awarded a $25,000 grant from USTAR North’s Go-To-Market program.

We’re so excited about this that it’s been hard to keep inside since they sent us the acceptance emails.

Six teams received the grant LearnStack was awarded. The USTAR program is helping good teams strengthen their product before going to market or fundraising.

There are opportunities to start a business anywhere in the country. You can find advisors, money, and co-founders wherever you go. There is, however, something special about what is going on here in Utah. The energy is palpable. What [Alex Lawrence](http://startupflavor.com/about/) is doing for [Ogden](http://startupogden.com) alone is mind blowing.

This state is the best place in the world to start a business.
